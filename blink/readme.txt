This place is a message, and part of a system of messages. 
Pay attention to it! 
Sending this message was important to us. 
We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.

This place is not a place of honor. 
No highly esteemed deed is commemorated here; nothing valued is here. 
What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us. 
This message is a warning about danger. 
The danger is in a particular location, it increases towards a center, 
the center of danger is here, of a particular size and shape, and below us.
